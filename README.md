# The effect of capital gains tax exemptions in non-agricultural private employment in Puerto Rico

## Abstract
|I analyze the effect of a capital gains tax exemption in employment in Puerto Rico. Actual employment was not different from what was expected based on counterfactual scenarios where the change in policy did not happen. Results suggest that the change in policy had a null effect on the three sectors where this policy sought to increase employment.
